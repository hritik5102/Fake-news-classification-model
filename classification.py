The report further alleged that Trump's original name is Dawood Ibrahim Khan. In the video, the Neo News anchor elaborated on Trump's journey from North Waziristan to England and then finally to Queens, New York.  Neo news had cited tweets and a picture on social media to back its claim. The video was broadcast last month but went viral after Trumpâ€™s election victory on November 8."
